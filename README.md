# PersonalJournal
One of the earliest Android programs I have made. Utilizes Firebase Realtime Database as well as Firebase storage and authentication. Application allows you to create and read journal entries. Up to four images can be added to each journal entry. A wide variety of customizations can be added to each entry such as text size, font color, and background color. The values selected are stored with each post so that the journal entry customizations persist when displayed from one session to the next.

Future updates might include the adoption of an MVVM architecture, the ability to edit entries, insert images into an existing entry and possibly the use of AES encryption for entries stored in the Firebase RTDB.
